### Install AWS CLI

I was not able to use Gitpod or Github Codespaces due to browser issues.
So I decided to use local environment.

In order to prove that I am able to use the AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

I install the AWS CLI via command in **Command Prompt**:

```
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
```

I attempt to run the command by typing in `aws`

```
C:\Users\Valdano>aws
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
